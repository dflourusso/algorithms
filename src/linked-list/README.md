# Linked list

This is a test to implement a linked list reverse function.

We have the `LinkedList` class where each list item is referenced to the next item like this:
`a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g -> h -> i -> j -> k -> None`

## The chalenge

The chalange is to implement a function inside the `index.js` file, that reverses the list.
The expected output is `k -> j -> i -> h -> g -> f -> e -> d -> c -> b -> a -> None`

## Rules

- You are not alowed to change the `LinkedList.js` and `linked-list.spec.js` files.
- Just change the `index.js` file with your implementation
- To test if everything is working, run `yarn test src/linked-list/linked-list.spec.js`

Good look
